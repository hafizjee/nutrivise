        "english_answer": " It seems like you're experiencing an issue related to your nail health. Nails are primarily composed of keratin, a type of protein.\n\n1. The problem with your nails might be due to various factors such as poor nutrition, fungal infections, aging, or smoking. However, a deficiency in certain vitamins and minerals, such as biotin, iron, or calcium, can potentially contribute to brittle, weak, or discolored nails.\n\n2. A lack of biotin, a B vitamin, can lead to brittle or splitting nails. Iron deficiency may cause nails to be thin and grooved, while a deficiency in calcium can result in nails that are soft, ridged, or bumpy.\n\n3. To help support nail health, you can consider adding foods rich in biotin, iron, and calcium to your diet:\n\n- Biotin-rich foods: Egg yolks, nuts (almonds, peanuts, walnuts), whole grains, and legumes (beans, peas, lentils).\n- Iron-rich foods: Red meat, poultry, fish, spinach, lentils, and dried fruits (raisins, apricots).\n- Calcium-rich foods: Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt), green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, collard greens), and fortified foods (cereals, soy milk).\n\nIf your nail problems persist or are severe, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations tailored to your specific needs. They can also discuss potential supplements if necessary.",
